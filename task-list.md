## PDCA
> please refer Plan -> Do -> Check -> Action to improve this task list.

1. Task 1
```shell
1. tart time 8:50
2. end time 8:55
```
Check: Time plan too much, since there is no need to test bean.
Action: No need measure test time when measuring bean task.

2. Task 3
```shell
1. start time 8:58
2. end time 9:05
```

Check: Time plan too much, since there also is no need to test interface.
Action: We can merge interface to it's implement task.

3. Task 2
```shell
1. start time 9:15
2. end time 11:05
```
Check: Time spend a lot on little detail, and the implement is mass.
Action: Don't stack at some implement just go though, and don't pick fragment time (it means don't be disturbed).
